# About
This is a side project to develop a hybrid mobile app for studying for the ASA sailing certification. The targets are iOS and Android devices.

# Technology
Written in Clojure, Clojurescript, Reagent/React, Sass, and a bit of Foundation for layout. Uses a custom core.async pub/sub mechanism similar to Flux and the Reagent Re-Frame project, while avoiding writable cursors to maintain unidirectional data flow (sort of like FRP). Simple yet powerful.
